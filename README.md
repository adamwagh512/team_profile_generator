# Team Profile Generator

## Product Description
This is a coding challenge for unit 10 of the UT Austin Coding Bootcamp. The goal of this project was to make an app that would dynamically create a team profile based off information given during prompts. The information requested is varied dependent on the class of employee. This project required all of the information we have learned through Unit 10 of the bootcamp.

Special thanks to TAs Ian and Diem for all of their invaluable help during this project. I would also like to thank my tutor Jack Linhart for helping me figure out the final pieces of this project. My final acknowledgment is to Youtuber Joelle DesChatelets (github username: jdeschat). Although I didn't follow her example very closely, she gave me some ideas to pursue for this project.
